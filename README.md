- Fixing your bugs for other people is great

- Somethings will be hard and you wont know why
- You get a lot done when you don't care who gets credit
- Build it yourself with failing tests or small examples

## node serialport
## (part 1)
![fit](RS-232_full_serial_port.png)

---

![fit](serialport-unit-tests.png)

^ it kept breaking johnny-five and I wanted it to stop
"Cant test this because it's hardware."

---

- followed up with dozens of small tests
- fixed bugs I found while trying to test
- given commit access(!)

^ too afraid to merge anything though

---

![fit](docs-bugs.png)

^ first merge of my own work

---

documentation bug reports help a lot

---

Getting eyes on your work isn't showing off

---

## NPM

^ When does `install` get called? What are the default values? Hidden behavior!? what?

### https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

^ encourages you to read the source
talk to maintainers

---

- Read the source for reality
- Tests help define behavior as much as find bugs
- Docs always drift

^ Always read the source

wanted a docker cloud thing to host some community sites I like, docs are inconsistent and wrong a few places. I didn't write it down and I all I can say is read the source if you get lost and immediately open an issue.

# New Job

---

You only get beginners eyes once

---

Always file bug reports

---

- Ask questions (Respectfully)
- Help others with what you know and do triage
- If you're confused then so are others

# Work on tools you use

^
Shep isn't the most polished tool for lambda but it will be the best tool if you have similar needs to bustle

---

# Things I Want in Shep

- Custom builders `code => zip`

- Deterministic deploy artifacts `sha => deploy`

- Centralized Configuration for Lambda (not `shep`?)

---

# Nice first contributions

- Run Linters
- Delete stuff that's weird
- Ask questions

^
All this stuff makes for a more approachable and maintainable project

---

#Why?

^ asking you to do stuff for no reason is crazy

---

It's personal

^
I can only tell you why I do it
It teaches me new things
I get to learn about new problems
It's changed my carer
It gives me chance to work with people around the world
It's why I'm here today

# Projects that would love to see you

- Node-Serialport (talking to hardware of all kinds)
- Johnny-Five (JQuery for robots)
- PouchDB (JS document database)
