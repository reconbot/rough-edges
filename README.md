- Somethings will be hard and you wont know why
- You get a lot done when you don't care who gets credit
- Build it yourself with failing tests or small examples

### https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
![inline fit](npm-docs-2.png)

^ encourages you to read the source
talk to maintainers

---

- Read the source for reality
- Tests help define behavior as much as find bugs
- Docs always drift

^ Always read the source

^ wanted a docker cloud thing to host some community sites I like, docs are inconsistant and wrong a few places. I didn't write it down and I all I can say is read the source if you get lost and immediatly open an issue.
